                    We engage with young people particularly those who use drugs and those living with HIVto increase awareness, build trust, and facilitate positive change. Our approach involves reaching out to individuals and groups within the community to promote understanding and encourage participation in activities that aim to improve the health and well-being of community members. By reaching out to the members of the community we create a sense of ownership and responsibility among community members for the health and well-being of their community. By engaging and working collaboratively with community members, we gain valuable insights into the unique needs and challenges of a community and work to develop effective programs and services that meet those needs. This also results in the effective promotion of behavior change and addressing health disparities, as it involves building trust and creating relationships between the organization and the communities that we serve.
